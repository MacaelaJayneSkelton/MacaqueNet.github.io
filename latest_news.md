## Latest MacaqueNet Events
**Nov 2021: “Weaving the MacaqueNet” symposium** - In Nov 2021 we successfully hosted our first ever MacaqueNet conference. This 3-day symposium provided an opportunity for all the current data contributors to meet, discuss their research and learn about ongoing projects. Together, we discussed the future directions of MacaqueNet as well as the current state and future avenues of macaque social behaviour research as a whole.

## Updates From Collaborators
**Apr 2022: Cayo Santiago field site** - April 26th marked the start of the 2-day annual research conference for the Cayo Santiago field station in Puerto Rico, one of MacaqueNet’s many collaborator field sites. This year’s jamboree was extra special, as it was the first in-person event for the field site since before the pandemic! Over 60 researchers, including field assistants and early career researchers from global institutions including Cayo Santiago, Arizona State University, University of Exeter, New York Univeristy and Univeristy of Pennsylvania gathered to celebrate recent work on rhesus macaque social behaviour and genomics. Dr Delphine De Moor presented "MacaqueNet" and her current comparative project looking at links between social complexity and diversity. In true MacaqueNet style, each research group advertised their respective data resources, including the long-term behavioural database and tissue biobank. We are excited to see what kinds of collaborative studies emerge from this sharing of data at next year’s annual jamboree!
