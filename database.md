The MacaqueNet database contains social behaviour data from 14 macaque species, provided by 92 researchers from 56 field sites and research centres around the world. This database will initially facilitate two research projects, but will be available for macaque researchers to design their own projects at a future date. If you are interested in utilising this database and would like to receive an alert when it becomes available, please contact us. While the database currently contains behavioural data only, we are actively looking for other types of data including genomic, life history and ecological datasets, so we may allow MacaqueNet to grow to its full potential. If you believe that your data could be a perfect fit, please <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}" target="_blank" >get in touch</a>.

The data availability tool below allows you to browse through the MacaqueNet database to see what types of social data are available for each macaque species. For now, this uses the rhesus macaque data from the Cayo Santiago field site in Puerto Rico as an example, to show what the database might look like in the future. Available data include matrices of grooming, aggression, body contact and proximity. 
With the permission of the collaborators, use of the database will be carried out under FAIR data principles, to make the data **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable and **R**eusable. Information on how to request access to the database will follow in due course!
