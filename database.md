The MacaqueNet database contains social behaviour data from 15 macaque species, provided by 92 researchers from 56 field sites and research centres around the world. This database will initially facilitate two research projects, with the aim of it becoming a resource for other macaque researchers to design their own projects in the future.

While the database currently contains behavioural data only, we are actively looking for other types of data including biological datasets, so we may allow MacaqueNet to grow to its full potential. If you believe that your data could be a perfect fit, please <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}" target="_blank" >get in touch</a>.

The data availability tool below allows you to browse through the MacaqueNet database to see what types of social data are available for each macaque species. For now, this uses the rhesus macaque data from the Cayo Santiago field site as an example, to show what the database might look like in the future. Available data will include matrices of grooming, aggression, body contact and proximity.
