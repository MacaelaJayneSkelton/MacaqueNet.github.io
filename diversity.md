The different macaque species show the same social organisation but express different degrees of cooperation and competition between individuals depending on the strength of nepotism (or kin bias) and power asymmetries. In intolerant macaques, kin bias and power asymmetries are strong and an individual's social relationships are constrained largely to a few kin and same-rank partners. In tolerant macaque species, kin bias and power asymmetries are weaker, and show denser more diverse affiliative and aggressive social networks. It appears that tolerant macaques have more diverse social relationships and might therefore appear more socially complex, compared to intolerant macaques. There is a trove of data investigating these patterns either separately or with a few groups and species. 

This project will test this hypothetical link between social diversity and social complexity at a much larger scale than before, taking a cross-species comparative approach. We will analyse the types of relationships macaques form, more affinitive, more agonistic, more ambivalent, their frequency or density, and determine indices of diversity and complexity. We will then compare these indices controlling for phylogeny. This will give us insight into how we can define diversity and complexity better and more broadly, and whether or not social styles as currently conceptualised are associated with social complexity as further defined.
