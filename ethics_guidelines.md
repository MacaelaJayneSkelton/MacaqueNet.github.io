We have developed a some basic ethical guidelines for any project wishing to utilise OR contribute to the MacaqueNet database. These guidelines include the utilisation of animals and field sites. 

The following guidelines must be applied to ALL procedures and contributions in MacaqueNet projects:

- MacaqueNet projects must NOT be conducted using invasive methods.
- All participating researchers answer to an ethics committee which approves the project and is named in the respective publication. 
- All research conducted by contributors to MacaqueNet adheres to national laws and, if applicable, international regulations and guidelines on research with primates (e.g. AAALAC, ASAB, AZA, EAZA, GFAS, JAZA, NAPSA, PASA, USDA, WAZA, Weatherall report). 
- You must have full persmission to utilise field sites for data collection.
- Before contributing data to the MacaqueNet database, you must gain permission from all the researchers who own the data (e.g. those who contributed to the acquisition or management of that data).


For data collected from <strong>captive</strong> subjects, contributors must also adhere to the following guidelines:
 
- Researchers must always prioritize animal welfare over research aims.
- The research facility must provide the best possible housing conditions, enrichment and husbandry (including veterinary care). Optimum housing conditions are species specific, but at a minimum, the 5 freedoms must be met. Detailed captive management information can be found [here](https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/macaques/captive-management/).
- The facility does not currently acquire macaques from wild populations, unless the facility is involved in rescue and/or rehabilitation of animals that cannot survive in the wild.
- Macaques must not be permanently housed in social isolation, except for medical and/or safety reasons.
- Methods involved in any MacaqueNet projects must not inhibit any of the 5 freedoms, including food and/or water deprivation.

Please note, some MacaqueNet projects may have additional ethical requirements and may need to be assessed on an individual basis. 
If you have any questions, please [get in touch](mailto:{{ site.email }}).
