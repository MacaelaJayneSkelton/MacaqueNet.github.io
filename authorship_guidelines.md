We have created clear criteria for assigning authorship to anyone involved in current and future studies that utilise the MacaqueNet database. 

If you have been involved in one or more of the following roles, you will be granted authorship on any publications that arise from the studies you contributed to:

Due to the collaborative nature of MacaqueNet, contributors are encouraged to contribute data from as many individuals as possible.

Please note, it is possible that authors will have contributed to more than one of the roles listed above.



## Assigning Authorship

All MacaqueNet publications will be published with “MacaqueNet” as the first author. Individual authors will be listed in the authorship by-line after “MacaqueNet”. Authorship is claimed by putting one’s own name down in the document used to write up each project. The type of contribution must be specified in the author contribution section of each paper.

If you believe that another person’s claim to authorship is unjustified, you can contact us to verify the contribution and withdraw authorship if it has been unrightfully claimed. If you believe you should be a co-author on any future publications because you are involved in a current project, please [get in touch](mailto:{{ site.email }}).

## Journal Selection

All MacaqueNet publications will only be submitted to open-access journals.
