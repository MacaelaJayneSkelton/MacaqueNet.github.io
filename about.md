## What Is MacaqueNet?

MacaqueNet is an international network of researchers who have collected data on macaques from all four corners of the globe. MacaqueNet encompasses experts from every field of macaque research, from a wide range of field sites and institutions. Together, we can establish a culture where knowledge and resources are shared, to improve and expand the current state of macaque research. Only through cross-species comparative research can we truly identify which mechanisms drive behaviour and cognitive processes and shed light on when, why and how these evolved. In the last decade, the field of macaque research has grown at an unprecedented rate, making the macaca genus one of the most widely studied taxa in primate research. Now letâ€™s see what we can achieve within the next 10 years, together.

Thanks to MacaqueNet, we have been able to create an unparalleled multi-species macaque database (link to database page). The database will contain social behavioural data from at least 15 of the 24 recognised macaque species, collected over the last few decades by over 90 researchers at 56 different field sites. Available social data will include matrices of grooming, aggression, body-contact and proximity.

## Why Macaques?

There are many reasons why macaques are so well studied. All macaque species share a similar social organisation, with individuals living in large, mixed-sex social groups, males dispersing to a new group once they reach sexual maturity, and females remaining in the group where they were born throughout their lives. However, different macaque species differ greatly in the structure of their social networks. In some macaque species, individuals form strong bonds with only a few preferred partners, whereas in other species relationships are more undifferentiated and individuals are tolerant towards most of their group members. Our deep knowledge of the ecology and social lives of macaques, along with the availability of detailed observational data for many of the macaque species, make the Macaca genus an ideal study system in which to test the social and ecological drivers of variation in social behaviour.
