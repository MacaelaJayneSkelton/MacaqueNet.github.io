Although affiliative relationships between dyads are wide-spread in group-living animals, the evolved function of these relationships remains unclear. Macaques share a similar social organisation, but show substantial variation in their social structure, making them an ideal system in which to study the selective forces acting on social relationships. Using network-based approaches we will quantify variation in the expression of dyadic relationships between female macaques across several groups and populations of 15 species of macaques. 

The next step will be to link these differences in social structure to differences in social and ecological pressures, such as female hierarchy steepness, male reproductive skew, mean relatedness, climate & seasonality of the habitat and predation risk. We will also consider phylogenetic relationships between species as a driver of similarity between closely related species. By taking a cross-species comparative approach, we can uncover which types of social relationships are selected for under different socio-ecological contexts. Ultimately, we aim to explicitly address which types of social relationships are adaptive under which circumstances, and why.
